                              PROCMETER V3.5c
                              ===============

The ProcMeter program itself is a framework on which a number of modules
(plugins) are loaded.  More modules can be written as required to perform more
monitoring and informational functions.

The statistics that are displayed are grouped by module, with a menu allowing
selection of module and a sub-menu for each output available for that module.

APM
        Advanced Power Management information.  These outputs are only available
        if you have configured the kernel to have the APM feature.

Biff
        Monitors the e-mail inbox (in /var/spool/mail/<username> or
        /var/mail/<username>) and indicates the number of e-mails that are
        waiting and the size.

Date_Time
        The current date and time and the amount of time since the system was
        last booted.

DiskUsage
        Shows the percentage of the disk that is used and the amount of free
        space for each of the local disks that it finds are mounted or can be
        mounted when the program starts.

LogFile
        Monitors the size and number of lines and the rate of increase of these
        in a set of log files.

Memory
        The amount of memory that is used for programs, buffers, cache and the
        amount that is free.

Network
        The network devices and the amount of traffic on each of them.  It will
        automatically pick up available devices when it starts.

Processes
        The load average and the number of processes running and starting.

ProcMeter
        Information about the procmeter program itself.

Sensors
        Information from hardware sensors for temperature and fan speed (simple
        version with fixed scaling).

FanSpeed
        Information from hardware sensors for fan speed (requires libsensors
        library installed but does read sensors.conf file for system
        customisation).

Temperature
        Information from hardware sensors for temperature (requires libsensors
        library installed but does read sensors.conf file for system
        customisation).

Voltage
        Information from hardware sensors for voltages (requires libsensors
        library installed but does read sensors.conf file for system
        customisation).

Statistics
        Low level system statistics.  For example CPU usage, disk usage,
        swapping and paging.

VM_Statistics
        Low level system statistics about virtual memory (swaping and paging)
        for kernel version 2.5 where the information has moved from the Statistics
        section.

Stat-CPU
        Statistics about individual CPU usage including support for SMP
        machines.

Stat-Disk
        Statistics about individual disk usage (bytes read and written), with
        version 2.6 kernels individual partition information is included.

Stat-Intr
        Statistics about individual interrupts.

Uname
        The system information from the uname program, hostname and Linux kernel
        version.

Wireless
        Information about wireless network devices. It will automatically pick
        up available devices when it starts.

Longrun
        For systems with the Transmeta Crueso processor, information about
        longrun.  Will not work unless the kernel is compiled with CPUID
        support, and /dev/cpu/0/cpuid must be readable by procmeter.

ACPI
        Advanced Configuration and Power Interface information. These outputs
        are only available if you have enabled ACPI in the Linux kernel and you
        have the appropriate hardware.  ACPI can report various information
        about a system's battery, and may also have thermal outputs available.

CPUInfo
        Information about the CPUs in the system, currently only the CPU speed
        in MHz.
