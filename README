Installation
------------

Edit the Makefile to set the paths for installation (INSTDIR).

Edit the xaw/Makefile to set the X Windows compiler options if required.

make all
make install

To compile just the Athena widgets version use 'make procmeter3'.

For just the GTK-1.x version use 'make gprocmeter3' instead of 'make all'
(gprocmeter3 has not been converted to use GTK version 2 and is known not to
compile with it).

There are also two versions that don't have an X window display output, they are
a '-log' version that logs the data to a file and a '-lcd' version that will
display on an LCD device by using the LCDproc server (see
http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net).

The manual pages procmeter3(1), gprocmeter3(1), procmeter3-no-x(1),
procmeter3-lcd(1), procmeter3_modules(1) and procmeterrc(5) give more details on
how to use the programs.
