.SH NAME

procmeter3, procmeter3-xaw \- A user friendly system monitoring program.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B procmeter3|procmeter3-xaw
.I [\-h|\-\-help]
.I [\-\-rc=<filename>] [\-\-...]
.I [...]
.I [X \ windows \ options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.I ProcMeter
Displays one or more pieces of information about the operating system and other
resources.  Most of the information that is displayed comes from the /proc
filesystem.  The program is modular and very configurable.

.SH OPTIONS

The command line options are described below.
.TP
.BR \-h
Provides a help message listing the available outputs.  This will be different
for different computers depending on the Linux kernel version that is being used
and the hardware/software that is configured.
.TP
.BR \-\-rc=<filename>
Load the specified
.B .procmeterrc
file in stead of the searching in the usual places.
.TP
.BR \-\-...
A list of configuration file options that will override the values in the
.B .procmeterrc
file.  The format of these options is (for example)
.I \-\-resources.background=grey50
which is equivalent to the entry in the .procmeterrc file of

 [resources]
 background = grey50

All spaces around the equal sign must be removed and if spaces are required in
the value on the right hand side then quotes must be used around the entire
command line option.
.TP
.BR ...
A list of names of outputs that are to be displayed.  This can include any of
the outputs that are available (see the -h option).  For the CPU usage is in a
module named
.B Statistics
with an output named
.B CPU
and there are graph (-g), text (-t) and bar (-b) options.  To display the CPU
usage graph you would use the command line option
.B Statistics.CPU-g
.TP
.BR X \ windows \ options
The standard set of X Windows program options, see X(1) for information.  These
include
.B -geometry
to set the size of the window,
.B -display
to set the display and other general X window options.

.SH USAGE

When started the program will display all of the requested information in a set
of output panels (vertically aligned by default).  Each output can be either a
graph, text or bar, and can have a label indicating what it represents.  The
outputs that are displayed are those from the command line and those from the
.B .procmeterrc
configuration file.
.LP
The left mouse button will produce a menu of options that are specific to the
output that is selected.  The
.B Properties
option on this menu will give more detailed information about the origin and
meaning of the information that is displayed.  When the properties information
window is displayed, clicking on another output will change the displayed
information.  The
.B Move to Above
and 
.B Move to Below
options allow the output to be moved around in the window.  Selecting one of
these options will change the mouse cursor to a hand, use this to select another
output.  The output that was selected first will be moved to above or below the
output that was selected second.  The
.B Run
option on the menu (which may not be available on all outputs) will run the
specified command.  This may be to display a list of running processes, show the
amount of free memory or disk space for example.  This menu option is
configurable in the
.B .procmeterrc
file.
.LP
The right mouse button will produce a set of menus that list the modules that
are available and for each of them the available set of outputs.  There are
three types of output, text and two graphical outputs, these are indicated in
the sub-menus by icons.  Selecting one of the outputs from a sub-menu will cause
that output to be displayed if it is not already visible.  If it is currently
displayed then it will be disabled.  Those that are currently displayed are
indicated by a marker to the left in the sub-menu.  When the output is added to
the window it will be placed at the bottom, use the left mouse button to move it
if required.
.LP
The middle mouse button will display the sub-menu that is associated with the
module for the output that is selected.  This is one of sub-menus that are found
with the right mouse button.

.SH MODULES

The modules that are available for procmeter3 and procmeter3-xaw are described
in the procmeter3_modules(1) manual page.

.SH X RESOURCES

As with all X Window programs X resources can be used.  For this version of
ProcMeter (compared to previous versions) this is not the default method of
configuring the program.  The file $HOME/.procmeterrc contains the configuration
information.
