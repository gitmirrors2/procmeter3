.SH NAME

The \.procmeterrc configuration file for procmeter3.

.SH SYNOPSIS

This file contains the run-time options for the procmeter3 program.  These
include the outputs that are displayed, the colours and fonts that are used and
other options.

.SH DESCRIPTION

The resources for ProcMeter version 3.0 are stored in the .procmeterrc file
instead of using X resources.  This gives more flexibility and allows for much
simpler customisation.
.LP
When the procmeter3 program starts the
.B .procmeterrc
file is searched for in the current directory, the current users home directory
or the system default installation directory (named procmeterrc).  The file is
used from the first one of these locations that matches.
.LP
The format of the
.B .procmeterrc
file is a number of sections with the section names marked in '[]'.  As well as
the fixed sections (described below) there is a section for each module that is
named using the name that the module reports itself to be.  There are then
further sections for each of the possible outputs of each module.  To find out
the modules that are available run 'procmeter3 -h'.  Lines beginning with the
characters ';' or '#' are comments and continuation using the '\\' character at
the end of a line is allowed.
.LP
Below is listed the resource values and the sections of the
.B .procmeterrc
file that they can exist in.
.LP
The
.B library
section contains the information about the procmeter modules that are available.
.TP
.BR path=...
The pathname of the library that contains the compiled ProcMeter modules.
(defaults to the program's compiled-in installation location).
.TP
.BR others=...
A list of other modules to be loaded (full pathnames separated by spaces).
.LP
The
.B startup
section controls how the procmeter window ahould look when the program is
started.
.TP
.BR order=...
A list of the outputs that are to be started up in the order that they are to be
displayed (separated by spaces).  If command line options are also specified
then they appear after those specified here.
.LP
The
.B resources
section contains the general program resources, these are mostly the items that
were stored as X Window resources in previous versions of procmeter.
.TP
.BR horizontal=...
A Boolean to indicate that the outputs are stacked horizontally instead of
the default which is vertically.
.TP
.BR background=...
The colour to use as the default background for all outputs. (An X11 colour name
or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB.)
.TP
.BR foreground=...
The colour to use as the default foreground for all outputs. (An X11 colour name
or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB.)
.TP
.BR label-font=...
The font to use for the label that describes the output. (An X11 font name.)
.TP
.BR label-foreground=...
The colour to use as the foreground for the label. (An X11 colour name or an RGB
value in hex as #RRGGBB.)
.TP
.BR label-position=...
The position of the label relative to the body of the output.  (Either top,
bottom or none.)
.TP
.BR grid-foreground=...
The colour to use for the grid lines. (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex
as #RRGGBB.)
.TP
.BR graph-solid=...
A boolean to indicate if the graph should be solid (the default) or a single
line.  (yes or no, true or false, 0 or 1.)
.TP
.BR grid-min=...
The minimum number of grid lines to display on a graph.  (An integer.)
.TP
.BR grid-max=...
The maximum number of grid lines to display on a graph.  (An integer.)
.TP
.BR text-font=...
The font to use for the textual outputs.  (An X11 font name.)
.TP
.BR menu-foreground=...
The colour to use as the foreground for the menus.  (An X11 colour name or an RGB
value in hex as #RRGGBB.)
.TP
.BR menu-background=...
The colour to use as the background for the menus.  (An X11 colour name or an RGB
value in hex as #RRGGBB.)  Note: The background of all items on the same menu
must be the same due to the Xaw Widget set used.
.TP
.BR menu-font=...
The font to use for the menus.  (An X11 font name.)
.LP
The module sections e.g.
.I ProcMeter
These can contain any of the resource values which will then apply to all
outputs of this module.  There are also extra options that can be applied to the
module and as defaults for the all of the outputs of that module.
.TP
.BR options=...
A string containing options that are passed to the module at startup, different
modules have different options, see the procmeter3(1) manual page.
.TP
.BR update=...
The update interval for the output in seconds (an integer).
.TP
.BR graph-scale=...
The scaling of the graph, the number of units between each of the grid lines (an
integer).
.TP
.BR run=...
A string that specifies a program that can be run by selecting it from the menu
for the left mouse button.
.LP
The output sections e.g.
.I ProcMeter.Version
These can contain any of the resource or module options (except 'options') which
will then apply only to the specified output.  There are also options that can
only be applied to individual outputs.
.TP
.BR label=...
Changes the default label for the output to the specified string.

.SH EXAMPLE

Below is an example
.B .procmeterrc
file, it is a much reduced version of the system default procmeterrc file.

 [startup]

 # Procmeter version, clock, CPU graph, load text
 order=ProcMeter.Version Date_Time.Time_HM \\
       Statistics.CPU-g Processes.Load-t

 [resources]

 # The outputs, black on white
 foreground = black
 background = white

 # A large-medium size text font.
 text-font = 8x13

 # Solid graphs with at least 5 grid lines in grey.
 graph-solid = yes
 grid-min = 5
 grid-foreground = grey50

 # Black on white graph labels, small font, below the data.
 label-font = 5x7
 label-foreground = black
 label-position = bottom

 # Black on white menu items in a small-medium size font.
 menu-foreground = black
 menu-background = white
 menu-font = 7x13

 [ProcMeter.Version]

 # A smaller font than normal with no label.
 text-font = 6x10
 label-position = none

 [Statistics]

 [Statistics.CPU]

 # The minimum number of grid lines, they are 20% each.
 grid-min = 5

 [Network]

 # To pick up extra devices not automatically recognised.
 #options=ppp0 slip0
